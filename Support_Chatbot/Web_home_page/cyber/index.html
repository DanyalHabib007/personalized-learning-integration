        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to your guide to Cyber Security! In today's digital world, the
          importance of safeguarding information cannot be overstated. From
          protecting personal data to securing business operations, cyber
          security is an essential aspect of our connected lives. This guide
          will introduce you to key concepts and best practices in the field of
          cyber security.

      <section id="network-security" class="content">
        <h2>Network Security</h2>
        <p>
          Network security focuses on protecting the integrity, confidentiality,
          and availability of data as it travels across or is stored in your
          network. This includes measures like firewalls, intrusion detection
          systems, and secure communication protocols to keep attackers at bay.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Components of Network Security</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Firewalls:</strong> Act as a barrier between your internal
            network and untrusted external networks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Encryption:</strong> Protects data in transit by converting
            it into unreadable code.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):</strong> Monitors network
            traffic for suspicious activity.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section id="application-security" class="content">
        <h2>Application Security</h2>
        <p>
          Application security involves protecting applications by finding,
          fixing, and preventing security vulnerabilities. This process includes
          regular updates, code reviews, and using tools to scan for
          vulnerabilities, ensuring your apps are secure against attacks.
        </p>
        <h3>Best Practices for Application Security</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests.</li>
          <li>Keep software and dependencies up to date.</li>
          <li>
            Implement secure coding practices from the start of development.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section id="cloud-security" class="content">
        <h2>Cloud Security</h2>
        <p>
          Cloud security refers to the technologies and best practices designed
          to protect data, applications, and services in the cloud. With more
          businesses migrating to cloud environments, understanding how to
          secure these resources is crucial.
        </p>
        <h3>Essential Cloud Security Practices</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use strong authentication methods and access controls.</li>
          <li>Encrypt sensitive data stored in the cloud.</li>
          <li>Regularly back up data to prevent loss from cyber attacks.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="content">
        <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>
        <p>
          Web development encompasses the tasks and processes involved in
          creating and maintaining websites and web applications. This field is
          integral to building sites that function effectively and deliver
          content and services to users via the Internet or an intranet. It
          involves several layers of work, including web design, content
          management, scripting, and network security.
        </p>

        <h2>Front-End Development</h2>
        <p>
          Front-end development focuses on the client-side of web applications
          and websites. It deals with everything users interact with directly in
          their web browsers. Key aspects include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>User Interface (UI)</strong>: Designing and implementing the
            layout, colors, fonts, and interactive elements to ensure the
            website is aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>User Experience (UX)</strong>: Creating a seamless and
            intuitive experience for users, ensuring that navigation is
            straightforward and interactions are smooth.
          </li>
